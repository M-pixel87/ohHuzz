      <h2>Doggies</h2>
      <p>I’ve never had a pet myself, though my brother Higinio once had a cat. Sometimes I wonder if I’d need a pet out in the world as well I worry that a person might start to see themselves as my pet.. Like I’m the one deciding what they eat or that they feel the need to stay close, like a loyal doggie. But that’s only because what I want in a pet is different from what I value in a person. I appreciate a pet’s loyalty and comfort. But with a person, I admire their understanding and free will to choose to stay, to be a companion not out of obedience, but out of the want to stuggle together although i might be hard to deal with. </p>
      <h2>Apple Pie</h2>
      <p>My apple pie is a unique dish, a feeling that no other will do, though other plates may be just as appealing. The craving for it is strange to me like something from a list of recipes or a flock of sheep it feels incomplete without it. I know that if I were to drop my apple pie, another dish could take its place, but I would still remember it: the sweetness, warmth, and the slight burn id sometimes leave in my mouth when i was caught off guard (RBF whipped ..+1). The apple pie doesn’t make me the cook or give meaning to my existence in the kitchen, but it’s certainly a recipe I hope never poisons my heart and continues to keep me company at the table. </p>

      <h2>Fella</h2>
      <p>Well, of course I want it to be us against the world, fella, with Sawyer and Godzilla, and if you meant it that time you mentioned it a filled cradle just iff. I did find your dad's story funny about the peanuts, not the drinking too much one, haha. I do love it when you talk about things, it's nice to know your perspective and listen to you get excited about stuff. I do agree though, please let me know when you're mad or feel unfairly treated. That play sounds really exciting, I wonder if you've put more work into it. I know the playlist I made wasn't all 90s themed, I was just feeling that sometimes great things end and people are helpless to stop it in LHOPS, even though I didn't finish refining it. I love you a lot, fella, and I'd want to struggle in life with you, even if we get mad at each other sometimes. I do like writing letters, but most of the time I'm working and forget to go to the nearest post office down here, so I coded this up. </p>

      <p>With love,<br>Manuel Martinez</p>
